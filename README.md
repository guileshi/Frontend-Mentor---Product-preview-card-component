## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS

### What I learned

To make that challenge, i decided to learn about SCSS. SCCS is amazing, there's so many possibilities that it increase to your CSS. Its flexible, you can make function using CSS, you don't have to write EVERY SINGLE 'webkit'. It's so helpful and easy to use. 

### Continued development

How i said, it is my first time making a web application using SCSS, and learning about that is incredible. Of course i will continue using it.
